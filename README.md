# Bash Data Structure Methods

This grew out of some code I was working on a long time ago. I had written
a large and complicated application in Bash, and I had implemented a
number of crazy things in Bash.

After working on that, I thought -- could I generalize this to a set of tools
that allowed you to work with complex data structures in Bash?

This is the result, or part of the result. It's unfinished, but the ideas
are there. I haven't had to do anything complex in bash in many years.
